Use OpenCV on the images in order to make the white paper road lane stand out
even more, helping the neural network - can be a sepearte iteration

Turn the data preprocessing stuff into a class and then a library

Don't resize the images - let the model do this for you during max pooling
This can also be an iteration. Not resizing the images then allows you to
add more convolutional and pooling layers to the model making it deep.

What about lossless compression on the images before transfer - what will be
the speed limitations of this

What should the preset size of the RPi camera be? Now that we have the RPi
camera, you should start to learn how to use it with python, it should be
much simpler than using OpenCV

Also, do the neural network - say that we run out of GPU or CPU memory - therefore a CNN will be needed to reduce the size even more than usual.
