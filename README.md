# RPi-Self-Driving-Car
Raspberry pi based RC Self-Driving Car using Python, Keras, Tenserflow and OpenCV

THINGS TO DO:
  - [X] Don't upload dataset to GitHub :white_check_mark:
  - [X] Test Model with simple images - VERIFIED WORKING 84% Accuracy :white_check_mark:
    - [X] New SIMPLE CNN model - Working with 87% Accuracy
    - [X] Model tested with STATIC images [NOT LIVE] and accuracy of each test is written in comments of the code
  - [X] Simple send and recive / Client and server python script to send an image over TCP :white_check_mark:
    - [X] Client Server code imporved to be quicker in uploading and downloading
  - [ ] Improve Accuracy of model - shuffle pictures in random order / change parameters
  - [ ] Test Model with a live video feed
  - [ ] Create Client Server system with TCP in python for host Trained NN on Server and pass commands to client 
  - [ ] Create RPi python script for controlling motors
  - [ ] Adjust motors script to recive commands from server and control motors accurately
